# CUDAProject
FInal Project for "CUDA at Scale for the Enterprise"

# Project Description
This application generates a single PNG image showing an input grayscale image alongside its progressively downscaled versions. Given a value k (1â€“9) and an N x M image, it outputs a (3/2)N x M image containing the original and its downscales by factors of 2 up to 2^k.

Example input and output are in data/sloth.png and data/sloth-gray.png. Run it using run.sh.
